                        Established in 2023, Rhodes Coffee Co. is a mobile coffee bar and caf√© based in Pulaski, New
                        York,
                        specializing in organic, fair-trade coffee. The inspiration for this venture stemmed from a
                        fusion
                        of personal experiences and practicality. As a former nomad embracing the #vanlife lifestyle and
                        a
                        touring cyclist, I found myself captivated by the cozy cafes, vibrant coffee scenes, and rich
                        coffee
                        culture encountered throughout my travels across the country. Recognizing a need within our
                        community, I saw an opportunity to provide a much-needed service: a proper espresso bar
                        featuring a
                        diverse array of offerings such as acai bowls, smoothies, overnight oats, nitro and cold brew,
                        matcha, chai tea, and much more. Our carefully curated menu is free of artificial dyes and high
                        fructose corn syrup, with a predominant focus on organic ingredients.
                        With ample parking and a convenient location, it's easy to make Rhodes Coffee Co your go-to spot
                        for
                        that perfect caffeine fix or a healthy, satisfying snack. Whether you're a local or just passing
                        through, don't miss this gem!

                        Our semi-permanent location is at the intersection of Route 11 & 13 in Pulaski from May to
                        November,
                        open Thursday through Sunday.
